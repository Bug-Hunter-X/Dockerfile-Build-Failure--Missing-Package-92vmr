# Dockerfile Bug: Missing Package

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to install necessary packages.  The original `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python packages, but a crucial package might be missing from the `requirements.txt` file, resulting in a build failure. The `Dockerfile.fixed` showcases the corrected version.
